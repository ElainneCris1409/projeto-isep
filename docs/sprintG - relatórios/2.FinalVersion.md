# Relatório Sprint G - Final Version

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the activities carried out during Sprint G, finalising an important cycle in the project. Throughout this period, the main focus was to make progress on the outstanding tasks, finalise the planned implementations and review the current state of the project.

## 2. Overview of activities
## 2.1. Previous Contributions

During the previous sprints I contributed to the implementation of functionalities, documentation and resolution of identified problems. I would highlight my main involvement in Sprints D, E and F with the creation of documentation for functionalities, the implementation of API tests, the use of frameworks such as Jmeter and test automation tools such as WebdriveIO.

## 3. Status of pending activities

**API tests and automated tests**

**Task:** Develop API tests to cover the pending functionalities (Unpopular Posts and Check Average Comment).
**Done:** API tests for the Unpopular Posts functionality. [Unpopular](../../src/api_test/unpopular.posts.api.test.ts)
**Done:** API tests for the functionality Check Comment Average.[commentAverage](../../src/api_test/commentAverage.api.test.ts)

**Task:** Develop automated tests to cover the pending functionalities (Unpopulate Posts and Check Average Comment).
**Done:** Developed test for Unpopular Posts functionality.
**Pending:** Automated test for the Check Average Comment feature.

**Repository documentation and coverage tests**

**Task:** Revise all the repository documentation to present the coverage tests. 
**Done:** Documentation reviewed, % of coverage tests achieved. Functional smoke test.

**Commitments carried out as requested:**

**Task:** Ensure that commits are carried out correctly as requested.
**Done:** Ensure the creation of tags in the commits with the requested descriptions for each type of documentation to be committed.

## 4. Coverage tests

"Test coverage is a metric that reflects the degree to which the source code has been exercised by automated tests. In the context of this project, the coverage metrics were as follows: 15.37% for Statements, 11.47% for Branches, 16.64% for Functions and 15.5% for Lines.

This low percentage of coverage can be attributed to a number of factors, including time constraints during the sprints, prioritisation of deliveries to meet established deadlines and resource limitations, given that responsibility fell to a single person for an extensive project.

It is important to emphasise that, despite these limitations, there is a personal commitment to improving test coverage, not just as a technical requirement, but as a continuous quest to learn and adopt best practices in software development. This improvement in test coverage is perceived as a significant contribution to improving code quality and professional development in the context of the project."

## 5. Documentation Report of the E2E Automation Project with WebDriverIO for the DDD Forum Application

1. Introduction:
   - The project integrates with the API and the Database (MySQL) to ensure the existence of necessary posts for test case execution.
   - A global user was created via API to be common across all features.

2. Environment Setup:
   - The database is cleaned up in the 'before' hook.
   - The 'beforeFeature' hook invokes a setup to add and update posts, ensuring proper preparation for test cases.

3. Project Structure:
   - Each feature has its own setup, where integrations with the database and API occur to update posts and creation dates as needed.

4. Methodology:
   - Utilization of BDD methodology integrated with Cucumber.
   - Test scenarios were developed based on acceptance criteria, ensuring a behavior-driven approach.

5. Project Execution:
   - All necessary steps to run the project are documented in the README file.
   - The project is configured to access the frontend, backend, and database locally.
   - It's essential that the DDD Forum system is running locally for the E2E tests to proceed as expected.

## 6. Conclusion
Sprint G marked a crucial stage in the project, focussing on completing outstanding tasks and reviewing progress. Previous contributions ranged from documentation to technical implementations.

Challenges were identified in test coverage, mainly due to time and resource constraints. I am committed to improving this metric, seeking to improve code quality and adopt best practices.

I also highlight a specific E2E automation project, highlighting API and database integration, the methodology adopted and project execution.

All in all, the report reflects the continuous endeavour to improve the project, always striving for excellence and the application of best practices in software development.
